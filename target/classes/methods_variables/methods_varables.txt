Local Variables:
- Defined inside a method.
- Can only be used within that method.
- Must be given a value before use (Java does not assign any default value).

Global (Static) Variables:
- Defined outside a method but inside a class.
- Can be used anywhere in the class.
- If not assigned a value, Java gives a default value.

Is intialisation of global variable is mandatory?
A. They are not mandatory to intialise, if we did not intialise, JVM will take default values based on data types.
byte,short,int and long --------> 0
float and double ------------> 0.0
String ---------------------> null
boolean ---------------------> false
char ---------------------> empty space


Global variables can be public, default, private, protected and final
-Global variables are also called as Data members.


If local var and global var names are same first priority is always given to local variables because they are
inside method and nearer for execution to JVM
