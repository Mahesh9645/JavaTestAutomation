Automation Testing:
===================
• Process of tesing the functionality of an application, by the help of automation tools is known as Automation Testing.

Why we switch to Automation Testing ? (or) Advantages of Automation Testing ? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. We switch to Automaton testing when we have to do regression testing
2. While regression testing, there are lot of repetative tasks, and performing them manually is a boring job.
3. Also in regression when the product also increases, time taken to test also will increase. Hence, we switch to
       automation to reduce the time taken for testing.
4. To reduce the manpower/number of resources.
5. To obtan the test results faster.
6. To get quick ROI(Returns On Investment)
7. We can expect accurate results.
8. Due to tough competition, software companies need to deliver high quality product within less time. Hence,
      we switch to Automation Testing.
Notes:
======
• We cannot automate progression testing, because we don't know the flow of the functionality testng. 
• We sart automating from the second release. 
• Anything which is completely dynamic cannot be automated. 
 Ex: Pc-games, OTPs      
 
 Drawbacks/Limitations of Automation Testing 
-------------------------------------------- 
• 100% Automation testing is not possible. 
• Anything which is completely dynamic cannot be automated. 
• Anything which requires manual intervention(interaction) cannot be automated. 
 eg, what all cannot be AUTOMATED......... 
 1.OTP, CAPTCHA 
 2.Making Payments through swiping the Debit/Credit card
 3.Barcode scanner, QR code Scanning 
 4.Animation 
 5.Testing the quality of audio/video 
 6.Game Testing 
• We need skilled resources to do automation testing. 
• Cost involved in Automation testing is more compared to manual testing, because of tools are licensed and automation skilled 
      resources are paid higher. 
• We can't automate an unstable product, we have o wait for the product to become stable.(newly built features will not be automated)     


1.What is Selenium ? 

Selenium is a free, Open-Source, Web-based Application automation tool.

Selenium Versions / Selenium Components / Selenium Flavors 
----------------------------------------------------------- 
• Selenium Core 
• Selenium IDE - Record and play back tool 
• Selenium RC(Remote Control) / Selenium-1 
• Selenium WebDriver
• Selenium Grid - for parallel execution of tests across multiple machines and browsers

RC Drawback : 
------------ 
1. We need a server without which automation is not possible

They are 3 types of applications - 
1. Standalone/Desktop application : chrome, firefox, safari
2. Web application : gmail
3. Client server/Mobile application :
