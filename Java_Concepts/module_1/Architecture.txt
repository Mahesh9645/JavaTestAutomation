=====================Architecture of Java=========================

Diagram :
=========

Source code ========> java compiler =======>Byte code =====> JVM (java virtual machine )========>OPerating system .

Important points :
=================
Step-1:

-->whatever program we write it is called as source code,source code should always save as ext ".java"

Step-2: Compilation:

--->The process of converting our program into system understandable form t0 (byte code) is purpose of compiling a program.
---->Compilation is done at once, During compilation, compiler will check syntax errors like [ ], ;,(),{ },:,spellings 
and case sensitivity.
----->If anything is wrong we will get compile time error.If nothing is wrong there is one class file get generated (byte code file) with same 
as .class

Step-3: Execution:

---->-JVM -java virtual machine is responsible for execution of every java program
----->-JVM's can identify by ------> Public static void main (String [ ] args)
----->execution will happen in line by line manner ,during execution JVM will find logical error of program.
----->d take first line and give to operating system for execution, once OS responds that i understood that 
line and it sends second line and it continues till last line like this whole code of class file gets executed.


JDK-JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT
---------------------------------------------
- IF WE WANT TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE JAVA PROGRAM IN OUR 
SYSYTEM WE HAVE TO INSATLL JDK(JRE,JVM,SUPPORTING TOOLS 
AND SUPPORTING CLASSES)

Components of JDK
---------------------------
-JRE - java runtime environment
-JVM - java virtual machine

JRE : -IT IS USED FOR EXECUTING JAVA PROGRAM OR RUNNING JAVA APP

JVM : IT IS RESPONSIBLE TO EXECUTE EVERY JAVA PROGRAM.

Note: when we install JDK with that JVM and JRE are available.

JIT : Just In Time compiler
- It helps JVM by taking code of class file line by line and give to OS.
