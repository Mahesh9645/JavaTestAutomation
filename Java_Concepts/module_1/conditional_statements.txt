CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
----------------------

TYPE 1
-----------
- Depending on conditions it switches control flow of execution from one statement to another statement.

Syntax:
----------
 if(condition)
{
//Set of statements//
}
else
{
//set of statements
}

Type-2
----------
if(condition1)
{
// if body
}
else if(condition2)
{
 //else if body
}
else if(condition3)
{
 //elseif body
}
else
{
 //else body
}

Looping statements:
--------------------

Loop is defined as repeated execution.
- If a part of code is repeatedly executing in our program rather than writing it multiple times, we can define it only once
inside loop and run it as many times as we want
- They are basically of 4 types
1. for
2. while
3. do while
4. for each(Enhanced or Advance for loop)

for loop :
------------
we go for, for-loop if we know nmber of iteration priorly(already).
  syntax: for(initialisation;condition;inc/dec)
 {
 }
 
while loop :
---------------
we go for while loop if we don't know number of iterations.
   syntax: initialisation;
 while(condition)
 {
 inc/dec;
 }
 
do while loop :
-------------------
when we want our loop should run atleast one time then we go for do whle loop
  syntax: do
{
inc/dec;
}while(condition);
