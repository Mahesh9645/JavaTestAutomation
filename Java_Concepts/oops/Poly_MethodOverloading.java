/*polymorphism = One thing showing multiple behaviour is called as polymorphism
poly = many ,morphism = form 

. Compile time polymorphism :
-----------------------------
During compile time one thing showing multiple behaviour is called as
compile time polymorphism.
ex: method overloading, where during compilation, compiler will decide
which behaviour to be implemented so here methodname is same but depending
on type of args it shows different behaviour.
run()
run(int i)
run(char ch)
run(String s,int i)
