ARRAYS 
--------- 
• An array is collection of homogenous elements(data).
• Whenever we want to use multiple or group of elements or data at same
time we go for arrays.
• for ex: if i want to use 1 to 100 at same time, its not possible to
store in variables and use it because it is very lengthy process so
for such kind of situation, java has given arays.
• In java an array is an Object.

Syntax:
=======
arraytype arrayname[]=new arraytype[size];


Length variable: 
---------------- 
• It provides length of array and length will always calculated from
1.
ex: int a[]=new int[300];
System.out.println(a.length); 
Output is :300 	

• Array stores only homogeneous data i.e, in integer array we can add only integer data, if we add any other type of data 
we wil get compile time error.
